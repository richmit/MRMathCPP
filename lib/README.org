* Header Files -- the entire library is right here.

If you are using an IDE, then simply add the =lib/= directory, or the
=.hpp= files, to your project.  If you are using GCC/Clang on the
command line, then add the =lib/= directory to your include path with
the =-I= compiler option.  To use from CMake, see the file
[[https://github.com/richmit/MRMathCPP/blob/main/IncludeMRMathCPPLib.cmake][=IncludeMRMathCPPLib.cmake=]]
at the root of the repository.

In your code you can include just the specific headers you need, or
include them all by with =MRMathCPP.hpp=.

HAVE FUN!
