* Header Files -- the entire library is right here.

If you are using an IDE, then simply add this directory, or the =.hpp=
files, to your project.  If you are using GCC/Clang on the command line, then
add this directory to your include path with the =-I= compiler option.

In your code you can include the specific you need, or include them
all by with =MRMathCPP.hpp=.

HAVE FUN!
