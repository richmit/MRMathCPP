* MRMathCPP

MRMathCPP is a collection of very simple math routines very carefully
implemented.

What do I mean by "simple"?  This library started as a way to
simplify common constructs like ~abs(x1-x2)<eps~ into things like
~fc::near(x1, x2, eps)~.  Later I added simple things like =sgn= and
=max4=.  In short, this library is a collection of simple math things
I tend to use over and over again.
