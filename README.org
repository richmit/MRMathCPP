* MRMathCPP

MRMathCPP is a collection of very simple math routines very carefully
implemented.

This library started as a way to render common constructs like
~abs(x1-x2)<eps~ into more readable code like ~fc::near(x1, x2, eps)~.
Over time it grew to contain much more, but I've tried to keep the
focus on simple stuff like =sgn= and =max4= that I use over and over
again across several code bases.

* Use

If you are using an IDE, then simply add the =lib/= directory, or the
=.hpp= files, to your project.  If you are using GCC/Clang on the
command line, then add the =lib/= directory to your include path with
the =-I= compiler option.

In your code you can include the specific you need, or include them
all by with =MRMathCPP.hpp=.

HAVE FUN!
